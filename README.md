# CS480 - 3D Lighting Demo

This is a 3D model that demonstrates the following techniques:
 - illumination models: ambient, diffuse, specular plus attenuation
 - light sources: point, spot, infinite, ambient
 - shading techniques: flat, Phong, Gouraud
 
It also implements a depth buffer algorithm for backface rejection
